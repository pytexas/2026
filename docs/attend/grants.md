## Opportunity Grants

Our goal is to ensure that everyone who wants to attend PyTexas can do so, regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, ability or sexual orientation. 
One way we make this possible is by providing financial assistance to community members that are otherwise unable to attend.

In addition to already subsidized rates for individuals, students and those under the age of eighteen, this grant can be used by those in need to cover registration fees, hotels, and travel. 
These opportunity grants come directly from the PyTexas budget on a case-by-case basis.

Currently we have a limited budget and are evaluating what we can provide. 
Tickets are generally the easiest thing to grant, and we are aiming to have some cash to help reimburse travel/lodging.

If you are facing a financial hardship, or would not be able to attend without assistance, please fill out the application below.

**Important dates:**

* Applications will open 12/01/2025
* Applications will close 1/31/2026
* Applications will be approved mid February 2026
* Notifications will be sent out by the end of February 2026

**Grant applications from participants from Texas and surround areas will be 
prioritized first.**
